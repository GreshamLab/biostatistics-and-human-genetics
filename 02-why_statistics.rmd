# (PART) Statistics and Programming {-} 

# Why we use statistics

As described in the [introduction](#intro) the goal of this book is to integrate genetics, statistics and programming.

Statistics provide serve two complementary purposes.  We can use them to:

* provide summaries of data 
* make inferences from data

In the context of human heredity these two purposes are used all the time.  For example, 

* provide summaries of data
   + determine the mean level of expression of a gene
   + determine the distribution of normal body weights

* make inferences from data
  + test whether patients who take a drug differ from those who don't
  + test whether a specific variant is associated with a disease
  
In this book, we will look at using statistics for both summarizing data and making inferences based on a sample from a population.
