# Preface {#preface}

This book is authored using **bookdown**, an R package written by Yihiu Xie.  Documentation for writing documents using bookdown is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).  I wrote this book using [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

```{r rlogo, echo=FALSE, fig.height=0.1, fig.width=0.1}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rlogo.png")
```
