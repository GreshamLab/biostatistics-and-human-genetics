# The normal distribution {#normal}

In this chapter we will look at the normal distribution.

#Let's read in birthweight dataset and determine mean and standard deviation
#
#```{r}
#BirthWeight <- read.delim("files/BirthWeight.txt", quote="")
#bw.mean <- mean(BirthWeight$Weight)
#bw.sd <- sd(BirthWeight$Weight)
#```

<!-- Now let's plot a Histogram of the 53435 birthweights. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hist(BirthWeight$Weight, breaks=seq(0,6500,250), col="red") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Now let's plot a Histogram of the 53435 birthweights.Superimpose a plot of the corresponding normal distribution. Beacuse the probability density sums to 1 we need to multiply each probability density by the bin size from the histogram (i.e. 250) and the total sample size 53435 -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hist(BirthWeight$Weight, breaks=seq(0,6500,250), col="red") -->
<!-- xv <- seq(312,6492,10) -->
<!-- yv <- dnorm(xv,mean=3083,sd=548)*53435*250 -->
<!-- lines(xv,yv, lwd=6) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Plot a standard normal curve and draw a polygon for the for the area from -4..-2 under the normal distribution.  Let's add lines indicating the boundaries of 95% of the data -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nd <- seq(-3.5,3.5,0.1) -->
<!-- y <- dnorm(nd) -->
<!-- plot(nd,y,type="l") -->
<!-- xvals <- seq(-4,-2,length=50) -->
<!-- dvals <- dnorm(xvals) -->
<!-- polygon(c(xvals,rev(xvals)),c(rep(0,50),rev(dvals)), col=5) -->
<!-- abline(v=qnorm(c(0.025,0.975))) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Plot a quantile-quantile plot of the birthweight data and add a line -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- qqnorm(BirthWeight$Weight) -->
<!-- qqline(BirthWeight$Weight, lty=2) -->
<!-- abline(h=mean(BirthWeight$Weight)) -->
<!-- abline(v=0) -->
<!-- abline(v=c(-1,1)) -->
<!-- abline(h=c(mean(BirthWeight$Weight)+sd(BirthWeight$Weight),mean(BirthWeight$Weight)-sd(BirthWeight$Weight) )) -->
<!-- abline(v=c(-2,2)) -->
<!-- abline(h=c(mean(BirthWeight$Weight)+2*sd(BirthWeight$Weight),mean(BirthWeight$Weight)-2*sd(BirthWeight$Weight) )) -->
<!--   abline(v=c(-3,3)) -->
<!--   abline(h=c(mean(BirthWeight$Weight)+3*sd(BirthWeight$Weight),mean(BirthWeight$Weight)-3*sd(BirthWeight$Weight) )) -->
<!-- ``` -->
