# Statistical testing {#stat_test}

The fundamental steps for all statistical testing are:

1. State a null hypothesis (H0)
2. State an alternative hypothesis (HA)
3. Use a test statistic to determine whether our data are consistent with the null hypothesis
4. Determine the p-value, which is an estimate of the probability of getting a test statistic that extreme, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.

__The p-value is the probability of getting a test statistic that large or larger if the null hypothesis is true__


A null hypothesis says: 
+ “nothing is happening”
+ “there is no effect”
+ “there is no relationship”
+ “there is no difference”
